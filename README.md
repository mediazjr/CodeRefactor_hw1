# CodeRefactor_hw1

## Description:

For this assignment, I focused on updating the code to have semantic elements wherever possible while pointing directly to single use attributes with ids instead of classes. I replaced div elements with header, section, aside, and footer where appropriate to make the html easier to navigate. I was unable to remove certain divs within those elements without drastically changing the webpage layout so I left the inner divs, replacing their classes with ids to find them easier in the css. I added alt attributes to the images as well, and rearranged the css to follow semantic structure.
